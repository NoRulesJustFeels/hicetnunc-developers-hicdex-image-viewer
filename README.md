# Hic Et Nunc: Hicdex web app

These are the resource files needed for the [Hic Et Nunc: Hicdex web app][codelab] codelab.

The `start` directory should be used as a starting point for the codelab.
The `complete` directory can be used as a reference for the completed implementation of the codelab.

In this codelab, you'll  build a web app using the [hicdex][hicdex] API. Your app will display an image from the [Hic Et Nunc][hen] NFT marketplace. This web app will be a much simpler version of what the HEN marketplace web site provides to view the artworks that are available for sale.

## What you'll learn

* How to query the HEN artwork metadata.
* How to make an API call with the query.
* How to extract data from the query results.
* How to debug your code in a browser.
* How to display the image of an artwork based on the query data.

## Getting started
